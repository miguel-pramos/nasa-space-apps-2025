A 3D space mission construction and management game developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**. Design, build, and manage your own rockets and habitats for interplanetary missions!

## About the Game

In *Space Mission Constructor*, you take on the role of a mission planner and engineer. Your goal is to successfully complete missions to the Moon and Mars by designing and building functional habitats and spacecraft. You'll need to manage your budget and resources carefully to meet the mission requirements.

The game is built using the Godot Engine and is based on the "Starter Kit City Builder" by Kenney.
